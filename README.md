Texas hold 'em is one of the most popular variants of the card game of poker. This game includes many conditions of card combinations on which the winner is declared.

I love python and decided to build this game from scratch in python. The approach I used was Test Driven Development where I tested & validated each condition in a different environment and then included it in the main code.

I was successfully able to build the game and understood how TDD works which is the best approach to any development.

The IDE I used for this project was Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.
